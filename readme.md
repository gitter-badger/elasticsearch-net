* Low-level client that provides a one-to-one mapping with the Elasticsearch REST API
* No dependencies
* Almost completely generated from the official REST API spec which makes it easy to keep up to date
* Comes with an integration test suite that can be generated from the YAML test definitions that the Elasticsearch core team uses to test their REST API
* Has no opinions on how you create or consume requests and responses
* Load balancing and cluster failover support
* All calls have async variants

#[NEST](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-net/tree/master/src/Nest#nest-)
* High-level client that internally uses the low-level **Elasticsearch.Net** client
* Maps requests and responses to strongly typed objects with a fluent interface and object initializer syntax to build them
* Comes with a very powerful query DSL that maps one-to-one with Elasticsearch
* Takes advantage of .NET features where they make sense (i.e., covariant `IEnumerable<T>` result types, type and index inference)
* All calls have async variants
